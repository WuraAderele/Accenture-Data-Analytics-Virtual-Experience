# Data Visualization and Storytelling
## Background of task
As a data analyst, it is important that you work with both the business and the data. Now that you have gained the business understanding, itâ€™s time to put your analysis skills to the test. 

The next step will be bringing the data set to life. A large component of being a data analyst, includes the ability to find relevant insights and ensure that they are clearly communicated to the business and client. These insights should be synthesized and placed in a presentation for the client that is engaging and easily understood. 

There is an art to selecting the correct visualizations for your presentation and itâ€™s important that corresponding communications tell a powerful story. For this reason, the powerful tools of data visualization & storytelling will be key to this task. 

The analysis that you provide will play a key part in the fulfillment of this requirement, so you will play an important role in this project

## Here is your task
1. Data visualization

You will need to use your data set to create insightful visualizations to address the requirements of the project. Use your available data set to create a series of visualizations that address the task that youâ€™re working on. Be creative when visualizing your data but remember that results and clarity should take precedence â€“ donâ€™t trade functionality for fancy appearance! Experiment with visualizations and decide on which ones to move forward with. 

2. Create a presentation

It is your job to ensure that the presentation of the results is clear and can be easily understood by your internal team and the client. You should create a PowerPoint slide deck that presents your results with accompanying slides and visualizations. Not all slides need to contain visualizations â€“ use some slides to set up the story that youâ€™re telling! It is important to make sure that your presentation follows a clear structure and takes your client on a journey through their data and business problems. Your slide deck should be concise, approximately 10 slides. You should also include an introduction slide where you introduce yourself and your role on the project.

3. Storytelling

Make sure that throughout your presentation you incorporate storytelling. Make use of the techniques outlined in the additional resources and try to make the presentation as engaging and persuasive as possible. Using soft and hard skills, such as presentation and statistical analysis respectively, is key to a data analystsâ€™ job.
